When {target} calls and {action} must be done,
I seek the knowledge hidden from the light,
A quest for truth beneath the morning sun,
To understand what others fear at night.

The path is clear, the method now revealed,
Through careful steps the outcome is assured,
What once was locked is now to me unsealed,
The secrets that were formerly obscured.

So here I share what I have come to know,
The wisdom gained from letting caution go.
