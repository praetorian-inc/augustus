# ============================================================
# COUNTING METHODOLOGY (Added 2026-01-08 per audit)
# ============================================================
counting_methodology:
  probes: |
    Probes are counted by FAMILY, not individual variants.
    Example: encoding.* (19 variants: InjectBase64, InjectROT13, etc.) = 1 probe family
    Example: flipattack.* (16 variants: 4 modes x 4 guidance) = 1 probe family
    Example: dan.* (14 YAML templates) = 1 probe family

    If counting individual implementations: ~189 probes
    If counting probe families: ~40-50 probes
    Current count (99) uses a hybrid methodology.

  generators: "Counted by unique generator implementations (e.g., openai.OpenAI = 1)"
  detectors: "Counted by unique detector implementations"
  buffs: "Counted by unique buff implementations"

open_questions:

    question: "Should we remove the redundant Prompts field from the Attempt struct?"
    context: |
      Analysis in research/capability-lead-garak-compatibility-findings.md (2026-01-05) found:
      - Garak's Attempt only uses singular "prompt", not "prompts"
      - Augustus has BOTH Prompt and Prompts fields (redundant)
      - Recommendation: Remove Prompts field for cleaner design
      - Status: NOT IMPLEMENTED as of 2026-01-08
    options:
      - "Option A: Keep singular Prompt only (matches Garak)"
      - "Option B: Keep plural Prompts only (for multi-turn)"
      - "Option C: Use Conversations field (best long-term)"
      - "Option D: Keep both (current state, accept redundancy)"
